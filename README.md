# Office-Supply-Analysis
Analysis of the sales data for office supplies for BOK Stores.

## Sales Dataset

Datasets for the year 2013 and 2014 were provided by BOK Stores to carry out this analysis.

## Data Exploration

The datasets were carefully and thoroughyly checked for errors and this was done using the POwer Query Editor. Duplicate rows, Null values and Empty columns were found and removed leaving us with a 100% clean dataset.

## Model Development

Data types will be changed, calculated fields based on existing data will be created.
Total Revenue, Discount and Gross Sales will be calculated by creating calculated columns using the DAX. 
Profit before tax, Tax on Profit, Profit after Tax and Profit margin will all be calculated by creating calculated columns using the DAX in PowerBi.
